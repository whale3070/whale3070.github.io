<p>The percentage of Manhattan’s population underwent a significant fall from 1800 to 2000. The percentage of total population was 76%. That means most of the people were lived in Manhattan in 1800. But 200 years later, there only 19% population lived in there. </p>
<p>In the 1800, there were 60515 people lived in Manhattan. The population in Manhattan reached its peaked at 1900 which was 1850093. And then the population in Manhattan has gradually decreased in the last 100 years which was 1538096 by the 2000. </p>
<p>Other districts such as Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island only had a small amount of people in 1800. The total population in these area were only 18701. It was only 24% of total population.

<h1 id="修改后"><a href="#修改后" class="headerlink" title="修改后"></a>修改后</h1><p>好的，我仔细检查了你的这篇文章，发现主要问题集中在：</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>语法问题</strong>（时态混乱、被动&#x2F;主动用错、冠词、复数、介词等）</li>
<li><strong>搭配不自然</strong>（如 “most of the people were lived in” → “most people lived in”）</li>
<li><strong>数字表达不准确</strong>（“peaked at 1900 which was 1850093” → 数字前加冠词，逻辑更清晰）</li>
<li><strong>逻辑衔接欠流畅</strong>（一些句子跳跃、重复、衔接词不足）</li>
<li><strong>词汇层级不够</strong>（可以用更学术的表达，如 “underwent a decline” 代替 “underwent a significant fall”）</li>
</ol>
<p>我下面给出 <strong>改正后的版本（雅思 Task 1 风格，语法正确、逻辑清晰）</strong>，并在后面附上 <strong>逐句讲解和改法</strong>。</p>
<h2 id="✅-改写后的版本"><a href="#✅-改写后的版本" class="headerlink" title="✅ 改写后的版本"></a>✅ <strong>改写后的版本</strong></h2><p>This chart illustrates the changes in the total population of New York City from 1800 to 2000, across its five districts — Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island.</p>
<p><strong>Overall,</strong> the populations of all districts <strong>increased gradually</strong> over the two centuries. However, Manhattan’s share of the total population <strong>declined significantly</strong>, while the other districts grew steadily.</p>
<p>In 1800, Manhattan accounted for <strong>76% of the city’s population</strong>, meaning that most residents lived there. At that time, the population of Manhattan was approximately 60,515. It continued to grow and <strong>peaked at 1,850,093 in 1900</strong>. Over the following century, the population <strong>gradually decreased</strong> to around 1,538,096 by 2000, representing only <strong>19% of the total population</strong>.</p>
<p>By contrast, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island had relatively small populations in 1800, totaling about 18,701, or <strong>24% of the city’s population</strong>. Over the next 100 years, these districts experienced steady growth, reaching a combined population of <strong>1,587,109</strong>, accounting for <strong>46% of the total population</strong>.</p>
<p>By 2000, the majority of New York City’s population resided in Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island, together comprising approximately <strong>81% of the total population</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Overall,</strong> the number of both openings and closures <strong>fluctuated considerably</strong> over the period. The number of shop openings generally declined, while the number of closures showed greater volatility.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the period, in 2011, <strong>shop openings peaked</strong> at around <strong>8,500</strong>, which was higher than the number of closures (<strong>6,500</strong>). However, in 2012, the number of openings <strong>fell sharply</strong> to below <strong>4,000</strong>. From 2012 to 2014, it <strong>rose gradually</strong> but remained lower than the initial level, before <strong>plummeting</strong> to just <strong>3,000</strong> in 2015.</p>
<p>The number of <strong>shop closures</strong> experienced the most significant fluctuations. It <strong>rose and fell sharply</strong> during the first few years, but <strong>dropped dramatically</strong> to nearly zero in 2015 — the lowest point of the entire period. Nevertheless, closures <strong>recovered rapidly</strong> in 2016 and then <strong>stabilized</strong> at around <strong>5,000</strong> between 2016 and 2018.</p>
<p>By 2018, <strong>shop closures (5,000)</strong> still outnumbered <strong>shop openings (3,000)</strong>, in contrast to 2011 when the situation was the opposite.</p>

<p>The chart provides information about the changes in the ownership of electrical appliances and the amount of time spent on housework in a certain country between 1920 and 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong>, the proportion of households with electrical appliances increased significantly over the period, though the rate of growth varied among different types of machines. Refrigerators became the most common household appliance, showing a particularly rapid rise in ownership.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the percentages of households owning refrigerators and vacuum cleaners both <strong>plateaued at 100%</strong> from 2000 onwards. In contrast, the proportion of washing machine ownership remained lower, at around 70% by 2019.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the period, in 1920, almost no households owned a refrigerator. However, its ownership <strong>rose sharply</strong> over the following decades and eventually <strong>reached 100%</strong>.</p>
<p>The proportion of households with vacuum cleaners also <strong>increased steadily</strong> from 1920 to 2019.</p>
<p>By contrast, ownership of washing machines <strong>declined slightly</strong> from 70% to 65% between 1960 and 1980, before <strong>recovering gradually</strong> to around 75% over the next four decades.</p>
